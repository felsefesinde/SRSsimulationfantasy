_This is a problem prepared by me for IEEE Bilkent Student Branch "Code-IT or Leave It!" Warmup Round 2022. This was the Problem B, and this repository is prepared to make other developers fork the problem and contribute to the repository by enhancing the approaches to the problem to bring out much better solutions._

# Problem Description
Can is an EEE senior student at Bilkent University. The new semester is about to begin, and he wants to enroll in courses at the SRS platform. Although Can does not want to take any courses, the school administration requires him to take courses whose sum would be at least number N in the new semester. Numbers below N are not accepted, and Can does not want to take the credits above N.
However, there is no limit as to how many courses he can take, but their credit sum must be exactly N. Can gets curious about in how many ways he can select the courses in the SRS platform. He learns from his friends that he can find the list of the course credits where infinite numbers of courses exist.

It should be noted that the order of the courses does not matter. 

# INPUT 
The input format is given in the following:
* First line of the input is the limit of the sum of the credits N.
* Second line of the input is the list of the type of credits. The sum N could be the sum of the numbers present in this list. Not all the numbers in the list do not have to be used, and they can be used in any count. 


| INPUT | Description| 
| -------- | -------- | 
| 4   |  First line shows the number N of the credits Can wants to take
|1 2 3 | Second line are the types of credits courses can have |

# OUTPUT
* You are expected to only print the number of combinations Can take certain course credits.

# Hint
There are several solutions to this problem, and most of them depend on one of the two following principles, so maybe you can choose one and proceed with the one which you feel most comfortable with: 
1. for loops
2. recursion
